## Assignment for the CE154 Web Development

### Brief

For this assignment, you will design a website using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and (possibly)
javascript. Pay careful attention to the requirements outlined below. I have provided examples of
similar services in the introduction paragraph to this document.

For this assignment, you must write your server-side code in PHP, and use MySQL for your
database. You can customise the SQL script to suit your needs, but you should not remove existing
data. I have provided a sample database design with this document to get you started. Your
submission should contain the (working) reset script.
The website will consist of four key parts:
- A list of games (the games catalogue)
- Game Reviews (submitted by users)
- Game Bookmarks (a simplified wishlist)
- User accounts
